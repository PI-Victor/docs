# Clouds

Juju has built-in support for all major public clouds such as AWS (Amazon),
Azure (Microsoft), and GCE (Google), as well as for others. This means that no
preliminary work is needed to "teach" Juju about these clouds. You simply
provide Juju with your cloud credentials and start deploying applications.
Private clouds like MAAS and OpenStack also work very well but naturally
require some extra configuration on your part.

This page contains general information about using clouds with Juju. To start
immediately with your chosen cloud you can go directly to
[Cloud credentials][credentials].

## Listing and updating cloud information

To see which clouds Juju is aware of use the `clouds` command:

```bash
juju clouds
```

This will return a list very similar to:

```no-highlight
Cloud        Regions  Default          Type        Description
aws               14  us-east-1        ec2         Amazon Web Services
aws-china          1  cn-north-1       ec2         Amazon China
aws-gov            1  us-gov-west-1    ec2         Amazon (USA Government)
azure             24  centralus        azure       Microsoft Azure

localhost          1  localhost        lxd         LXD Container Hypervisor
```

Each line represents a backing cloud that Juju can interact with. It gives the
cloud name, the number of cloud regions Juju is aware of, the default region
(for the current Juju client), the type/API used to control it, and a brief
description.

!!! Important:
    The cloud name (e.g. 'aws', 'localhost') is what you will use in any
    subsequent Juju commands to refer to a cloud.

To see which regions Juju is aware of for any given cloud use the `regions`
command. For the 'aws' cloud then:

```bash
juju regions aws
```

This returns a list like this:
  
```no-highlight
us-east-1
us-east-2
us-west-1
us-west-2
ca-central-1
eu-west-1
eu-west-2
eu-central-1
ap-south-1
ap-southeast-1
ap-southeast-2
ap-northeast-1
ap-northeast-2
sa-east-1
```

To specify a different region, see
[Creating a controller][controllers-creating].

To change the default region for a cloud:

```bash
juju set-default-region aws eu-central-1
```

To get more detail about a particular cloud:

```bash
juju show-cloud azure
```

To learn of any special features a cloud may support the `--include-config`
option can be used with `show-cloud`. These can then be passed to either of the
`bootstrap` or the `add-model` commands. See
[Passing a cloud-specific setting][controllers-creating-include-config] for
an example.

To synchronise the Juju client with changes occurring on public clouds (e.g.
cloud API changes, new cloud regions) or on Juju's side (e.g. support for a new
cloud):

```bash
juju update-clouds
```

## Special clouds

There are three special Juju cloud types. They are deemed special because they
are based on a unique design or have particular requirements & limitations that
the other clouds do not have. They are LXD, MAAS, and Manual:

 - **LXD**  
 This cloud is based on containers running locally. It is quick to set up and
 is ideal for testing Juju and developing your own charms. For details see the
 [Using LXD with Juju][clouds-lxd] page.
 
 - **MAAS**  
 This cloud treats physical servers (or KVM guests) as a public cloud treats
 cloud instances. For details see the [Using MAAS with Juju][clouds-maas]
 page.
 
 - **Manual**  
 This cloud can be built from salvaged machines of varying types (e.g. bare
 metal, cloud instances, KVM guests) that cannot otherwise be leveraged by
 Juju. Its resulting feature set is limited and there are some particular
 requirements to make this work. For details see the
 [Using the Manual cloud with Juju][clouds-manual] page.

## Adding clouds

When the cloud you want to use is not on Juju's list of known clouds you will
need to add it. This is done with the `add-cloud` command, which has both
interactive and manual modes.

### Adding clouds interactively

Interactive mode is the fastest and recommended method to use. You will be
asked a series of questions based on the type of cloud you are trying to add.
You can also generate a cloud YAML file in this way.

This mode currently supports the following clouds: MAAS, Manual, OpenStack,
Oracle, and vSphere. Click on a cloud's entry below to reveal a sample command
session.

^# MAAS

   To add a MAAS cloud, you need to supply a name you wish to call it and the
   unique MAAS API endpoint.
   
   A sample session looks like this:
       
       juju add-cloud
  
       Cloud Types
        maas
        manual
        openstack
        oracle
        vsphere

       Select cloud type: maas

       Enter a name for your maas cloud: mainmaas

       Enter the API endpoint url: http://maas.example.org:5240/MAAS/api/2.0

      Cloud "mainmaas" successfully added
      You may bootstrap with 'juju bootstrap mainmaas'

   You must now add a credential for this cloud prior to creating a controller
   (`juju bootstrap`). See the [Credentials][credentials] page for details.
   
^# Manual

   To add a Manual cloud, you need to supply a name you wish to call it, the IP
   address (or hostname) for the machine you intend to use as a controller, and
   what remote user account to connect to over SSH (prepend 'user@' to the
   address/hostname).
   
   In terms of SSH, the user running the Juju client is expected to already be
   able to connect to the remote host (either by password or public key).
   
   A sample session looks like this:

       juju add-cloud

       Cloud Types
        maas
        manual
        openstack
        oracle
        vsphere
      
      Select cloud type: manual
      
      Enter a name for your manual cloud: mymanual
      
      Enter the controller's hostname or IP address: noah@10.143.211.93
      
      Cloud "mymanual" successfully added
      You may bootstrap with 'juju bootstrap mymanual'

   A Juju-added credential is not required. The ability for Juju to make an SSH
   connection is all that's needed.
   
   For help in configuring your own Manual cloud to work with Juju, see
   [Using the Manual cloud with Juju][clouds-manual].

^# OpenStack

   To add an OpenStack cloud, you need to supply a name you wish to call it,
   the unique API endpoint, the authentication type(s), and region information.

   Here we assume an OpenStack cloud that is equipped with the relevant Ubuntu
   images. For help in configuring your own OpenStack cloud to work with Juju,
   see [Using OpenStack with Juju][clouds-openstack].
   
   A sample session is shown below:
   
       juju add-cloud
       
       Cloud Types
        maas
        manual
        openstack
        oracle
        vsphere
       
       Select cloud type: openstack
       
       Enter a name for your openstack cloud: devstack
       
       Enter the API endpoint url for the cloud: https://openstack.example.com:35574/v3.0/
       
       Auth Types
        access-key
        userpass
       
       Select one or more auth types separated by commas: access-key,userpass
       
       Enter region name: dev1
       
       Enter the API endpoint url for the region: https://openstack-dev.example.com:35574/v3.0/
       
       Enter another region? (Y/n): n
       
       Cloud "devstack" successfully added
       You may bootstrap with 'juju bootstrap homestack'
       
   Separate multiple authentication types with commas (as shown above).

   You must now add a credential for this cloud prior to creating a controller
   (`juju bootstrap`). See the [Credentials][credentials] page for details.

^# Oracle

   You should only need to do this if you're using an Oracle trial account as
   the regular (paid) Oracle cloud is built-in. See
   [Oracle Compute][clouds-oracle] for both types of accounts.

   You will first need to make one or more Ubuntu images available via the
   Oracle web dashboard. See the [Ubuntu images][clouds-oracle-images] section.

   To add an Oracle Compute cloud, you need to supply a name you wish to call
   it and the unique API endpoint.
   
   A sample session is shown below:

       juju add-cloud

       Cloud Types
        maas
        manual
        openstack
        oracle
        vsphere
       
       Select cloud type: oracle

       Enter a name for your oracle cloud: oracle-trial
       
       Enter the API endpoint url for the cloud: https://api-z41.compute.em3.oraclecloud.com/

       Cloud "oracle-trial" successfully added
       You may bootstrap with 'juju bootstrap oracle-trial'

   The 'API endpoint url' in this case is the REST endpoint of the Compute
   domain.

   You must now add a credential for this cloud prior to creating a controller
   (`juju bootstrap`). See the [Credentials][credentials] page for details.

^# vSphere

   To add a vSphere cloud, you need to supply a name you wish to call it, the
   unique API endpoint, and region information.
   
   A sample session is shown below:

       juju add-cloud

       Cloud Types
         maas
         manual
         openstack
         oracle
         vsphere
       
       Select cloud type: vsphere

       Enter a name for your vsphere cloud: vs1
       
       Enter the API endpoint url for the cloud: 178.18.42.10
       
       Enter region name: dc0
       
       Enter another region? (Y/n): y
       
       Enter region name: dc1
       
       Enter another region? (Y/n): n
       
       Cloud "vs1" successfully added
       You may bootstrap with 'juju bootstrap vs1'

   The 'API endpoint url' in this case is the IP address of the vSphere server.
   We have also specified multiple regions ("data centres" in vSphere
   terminology).

   You must now add a credential for this cloud prior to creating a controller
   (`juju bootstrap`). See the [Credentials][credentials] page for details.

### Adding clouds manually

As an alternative to the interactive method, clouds can be added manually. This
can assist with automation.

The manual method necessitates the use of a [YAML-formatted][yaml]
configuration file. It has the following format:

```yaml
clouds:
  <cloud_name>:
    type: <type_of_cloud>
    auth-types: [<authenticaton_types>]
    regions:
      <region-name>:
        endpoint: <https://xxx.yyy.zzz:35574/v3.0/>
```

The table below shows the authentication types available for each cloud type.
It does not include the `interactive` type as it does not apply in the context
of adding a cloud manually.

| cloud type      | authentication types            |
|-----------------|---------------------------------|
`azure`		  | `service-principal-secret`
`cloudsigma`	  | `userpass`
`ec2`		  | `access-key`
`gce`		  | `jsonfile,oauth2`
`joyent`	  | `userpass`
`lxd`		  | n/a
`maas`		  | `oauth1`
`manual`	  | n/a
`openstack` 	  | `access-key,userpass`
`oracle`	  | `userpass`
`rackspace`	  | `userpass`
`vsphere`	  | `userpass`

To add a cloud in this way we simply supply an extra argument to specify the
relative path to the file:
 
`juju add-cloud <cloud-name> <cloud-file>`

To confirm that the cloud has been successfully added you can re-run the
`clouds` command.

Below we provide two examples.

#### Manually adding MAAS clouds

This example covers manually adding a MAAS cloud to Juju. It also demonstrates
how multiple clouds of the same type can be defined and added.

Here is the YAML file:

```yaml
clouds:
   devmaas:
      type: maas
      auth-types: [oauth1]
      endpoint: http://devmaas/MAAS
   testmaas:
      type: maas
      auth-types: [oauth1]
      endpoint: http://172.18.42.10/MAAS
   prodmaas:
      type: maas
      auth-types: [oauth1]
      endpoint: http://prodmaas/MAAS
```

This defines three MAAS clouds and refers to them by their respective
region controllers.

To add clouds 'devmaas' and 'prodmaas', assuming the configuration file is
`maas-clouds.yaml` in the current directory, we would run:

```bash
juju add-cloud devmaas maas-clouds.yaml
juju add-cloud prodmaas maas-clouds.yaml
```

You must now add a credential for this cloud prior to creating a controller
(`juju bootstrap`). See the [Credentials][credentials] page for details. The
[Using MAAS with Juju][clouds-maas-add-credentials] page also includes
MAAS-specific guidance on this.

#### Manually adding an OpenStack cloud

This examples shows how to manually add an OpenStack cloud to Juju. It also
demonstrates how multiple authentication types can be allowed
(comma-separated).

Here we assume an OpenStack cloud that is equipped with the relevant Ubuntu
images. For help in configuring your own OpenStack cloud to work with Juju, see
[Using OpenStack with Juju][clouds-openstack].

Here is the YAML file:

```yaml
clouds:
    mystack:
      type: openstack
      auth-types: [access-key,userpass]
      regions:
        dev1:
          endpoint: https://openstack.example.com:35574/v3.0/
```

To add cloud 'mystack', assuming the configuration file is `mystack.yaml` in
the current directory, we would run:
  
```bash
juju add-cloud mystack mystack.yaml
```

You must now add a credential for this cloud prior to creating a controller
(`juju bootstrap`). See the [Credentials][credentials] page for details.
