# Using OpenStack with Juju

Although Juju doesn't have baked-in knowledge of *your* OpenStack cloud, it
does know how such clouds work in general. We just need to provide some
information to add it to the list of known clouds.

## Adding an OpenStack Cloud

Using the Juju `add-cloud` command, it is easy to add your OpenStack clouds to
Juju's list of known clouds. The command is interactive, and will ask for
a name, endpoint, authorisation method(s) and regions to use. (If you are unsure
about endpoints and regions, they will be listed in the novarc file, if you
have one for your OpenStack.) A sample session is shown below.

Running...

```bash
juju add-cloud
```
...will enter the interactive mode. Enter the desired values to continue.

```
Cloud Types
 maas
 manual
 openstack
 vsphere

Select cloud type: openstack

Enter a name for your openstack cloud: mystack

Enter the API endpoint url for the cloud: https://openstack.example.com:35574/v3.0/

Auth Types
 access-key
 userpass

Select one or more auth types separated by commas: access-key,userpass

Enter region name: dev1

Enter the API endpoint url for the region: https://openstack-dev.example.com:35574/v3.0/

Enter another region? (Y/n): n

Cloud "mystack" successfully added
You may bootstrap with 'juju bootstrap mystack'
```

Note that it is possible to choose more than one authorisation method - just
separate the values with commas.

Once the cloud has been added, it will appear on the list of known clouds
output by the `juju clouds` command. Note that the cloud name will be
highlighted to indicate that it is a locally added cloud.

It is also possible to define OpenStack clouds in a YAML formatted configuration
file and register them with Juju. Please see the
[documentation for manually adding Openstack clouds][manual-openstack] for details.

## Gathering credential information

The credential information is found on your private or public OpenStack
account.

## Adding credentials

In order to access OpenStack, you will need to add credentials to Juju. This
can be done in one of three ways.

### Using the interactive method

Armed with the gathered information, you can add credentials with the command:

```bash
juju add-credential myopenstack
```

The command will interactively prompt you for the information needed for the
chosen cloud. For the authentication type, either 'access-key', 'userpass', or
'access-key,userpass' (i.e. both are allowed) can be selected.

Alternately, you can use these credentials with [Juju as a Service][jaas] where
you can deploy charms using a web GUI.

### Using a file

A YAML-formatted file, say `mycreds.yaml`, can be used to store credential
information for any cloud. This information is then added to Juju by pointing
the `add-credential` command to the file:

```bash
juju add-credential myopenstack -f mycreds.yaml
```

See section [Adding credentials from a file][credentials-adding-from-file] for
guidance on what such a file looks like.

### Using environment variables

With OpenStack you have the option of adding credentials using the following
environment variables that may already be present (and set) on your client
system:

`OS_USERNAME`  
`OS_PASSWORD`  
`OS_TENANT_NAME`  
`OS_DOMAIN_NAME`

Add this credential information to Juju in this way:
  
```bash
juju autoload-credentials
```

For any found credentials you will be asked which ones to use and what name to
store them under.

On Linux systems, the file `$HOME/.novarc` may be used to define these
variables and is parsed by the above command as part of the scanning process.

For background information on this method read section
[Adding credentials from environment variables][credentials-adding-from-variables].

## Images and private clouds

The above steps are all you need to use most OpenStack clouds which are
configured for general use. If this is your own cloud, you will also need to
additionally provide stream information so that the cloud can fetch the
relevant images for Juju to use. This is covered in the section on
[private clouds][simplestreams]. 

## Creating a controller

Once the image metadata has been gathered, either locally or via a registered
and running Simplestream service, check your OpenStack networks.  If there are
multiple possible networks available to the cloud, it is also necessary to
specify the network name or UUID for Juju to use to boot instances. Both the
network name and UUID can be retrieved with the following command:

```bash
openstack network list
```

Choose the network you want the instances to boot from.  You can use either the
network name or the UUID with the 'network' configuration option when
bootstrapping a new controller.

With the product-streams service running in your OpenStack Cloud, you are now
ready to create a Juju controller:

```bash
juju bootstrap <cloud> <controller name> --config network=<network_id>
```

or if the simplestream data is local:

```bash
juju bootstrap <cloud> <controller name> --metadata-source ~/simplestreams/images --config network=<network_id>
```

For a detailed explanation and examples of the `bootstrap` command see the
[Creating a controller][controllers-creating] page.

## Next steps

A controller is created with two models - the 'controller' model, which
should be reserved for Juju's internal operations, and a model named
'default', which can be used for deploying user workloads.
